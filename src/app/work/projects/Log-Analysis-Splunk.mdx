## Overview

Built a comprehensive log analysis and data modeling system using Splunk to centralize, parse, and visualize logs from multiple sources. The project focused on identifying security anomalies, performance bottlenecks, and operational trends to improve decision-making and system reliability.

## Key Features

- **Log Aggregation & Parsing**: Collected and normalized logs from Windows Event Logs. 
- **Data Modeling**: Designed custom Splunk data models to organize logs efficiently, enabling rapid querying and reporting.
- **Dashboards & Visualizations**: Created interactive dashboards to monitor system activity, security events, and performance metrics in real-time.


- **Splunk**: For log collection, indexing, searching, and visualization.
- ** SPL and EventCodes**: To perform effective searches and understand what security related searches are performed and monitored daily as a SOC analyst. 
- **Data Modeling & Dashboards**: For creating actionable visual insights and interactive reports.

## Challenges and Learnings

Challenges included handling large volumes of log data efficiently and creating data models that are both flexible and performant. Learning to craft optimized searches, understanding the effectivness of understanding useful eventcodes, their definitions and SPL, and design insightful dashboards significantly improved the overall monitoring and analysis process.

## Outcome

The project resulted in a fully functional log analysis workflow that streamlines monitoring, enhances security visibility, and supports data-driven decision-making. It serves as a foundation for future automation and advanced analytics initiatives within IT and cybersecurity operations.
