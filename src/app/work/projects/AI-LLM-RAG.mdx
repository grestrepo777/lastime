## Overview

Built an interactive AI code sandbox leveraging a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Users can input code snippets and receive context-aware responses, explanations, or suggested improvements, demonstrating practical applications of LLMs in code analysis and experimentation.  

## Key Features

- **Interactive Code Input**: Users can submit arbitrary code snippets to the sandbox for real-time analysis.
- **Context-Aware AI Responses**: The RAG pipeline retrieves relevant code patterns or examples to provide informed suggestions and explanations. 
- **Experimentation Environment**: Provides a safe environment to test code, explore behavior, and validate AI-driven insights. 
- **Extensible**: Designed to handle multiple code inputs and languages while remaining responsive and reliable. 

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core backend logic and RAG pipeline implementation. 
- **OpenAI / LLMs**: Generates intelligent responses and suggestions for user-provided code.
- **Vector Database**: Stores code embeddings for efficient semantic retrieval. 

## Challenges and Learnings

A key challenge was ensruing that the AI provided relevant and accurate suggestions for diverse code snippets. This required fine-tuning the prompts to make sure the responses were valid and helpful. 
Also, making sure I had a good understanding of what each component in the RAG pipeline was supposed to do was important to consider. 

## Outcome

The RAG-powered AI code sandbox allows users to interactively analyze, explore, and understand code snippets.
