## Overview

Built an interactive AI code sandbox leveraging a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Users can input code snippets and receive context-aware responses, explanations, or suggested improvements, demonstrating practical applications of LLMs in code analysis and experimentation.  

## Key Features

- **Interactive Code Input**: Users can submit arbitrary code snippets to the sandbox for real-time analysis.
- **Context-Aware AI Responses**: The RAG pipeline retrieves relevant code patterns or examples to provide informed suggestions and explanations. 
- **Experimentation Environment**: Provides a safe environment to test code, explore behavior, and validate AI-driven insights. 
- **Extensible**: Designed to handle multiple code inputs and languages while remaining responsive and reliable. 

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core backend logic and RAG pipeline implementation. 
- **OpenAI / LLMs**: Generates intelligent responses and suggestions for user-provided code.
- **Vector Database**: Stores code embeddings for efficient semantic retrieval. 

## Challenges and Learnings

A key challenge was ensruing that the AI provided relevant and accurate suggestions for diverse code snippets. This required fine-tuning the prompts to make sure the responses were valid and helpful. 
Also, making sure I had a good understanding of what each component in the RAG pipeline was supposed to do was important to consider. 

## Outcome

The RAG-powered AI code sandbox allows users to interactively analyze, explore, and understand code snippets.

This project demonstrates the practical application of LLMs for code reasoning, experimentation, and education as well as providing a secure and safe sandbox to learn and practice. This showcases my ability to combine AI with developer-focused tools.
