## Overview

This projected invovled building and configuring a Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Suricata to analyze replayed network traffic downloaded from a .pcap file online using tcpreplay. Captured packets were sent through a virtual network interface allowing suricata to generate alerts based on suspicious patterns. The environment was managed through PuTTY for remote access and system control, emphasizing real-world SOC workflows such as alert investigation, log correlation, and network event interpretation. 

## Key Features

- **Implemented Suricata IDS**: Allows me to monitor network traffic and detect potential threats using rule-based detection. 
- **Analyzed Network Packets**: I was able to extract important information and familiarize myself with pcap files and figure out what it is I need to look for when analyzing packets. 
- **Correlated Alerts and Network Behavior**: I was able to identify abnormal traffic patterns and prioritize incidents. 
- **Used PuTTY for Secure SSH Access**: I learned how to remotely manage and monitor my Ubuntu Server environment. 

## Technologies Used

- **Linux - Ubuntu Server**: Operating system used for the project.  
- **Suricata**: Used to perform rule based packet inspection and alerts.  
- **PuTTY**: Used to remotely manage Linux-based tools. I also wanted to understand how to connect my VM to PuTTY because I did not think it was possible before this project. 
- **tcpreplay**: To download packet captures

## Challenges and Learnings

The biggest challenge was actually PuTTY itself. It was the first time I have ever used it and prior to this project I did not know that I could connect it to a VM. I came across challenges when trying to connect the VM to PuTTY itself. I found a temporary solution by switching between bridged adpaters and NAT in the network settings on the VM. Another challenge was building Suricata from scratch, which was what I did. I found that it was more customizable doing it that way but a lot more confusing. Going through the .yaml file on Suricata and looking for what I needed to change was a challenge but it was rewarding because the final outcome worked how I wanted it to work. 

## Outcome

The final outcome was an intrusion detection system that took in a large packet capture that I downloaded online and using rules downloaded online suricata was able to label different event by severity and other descriptions.
