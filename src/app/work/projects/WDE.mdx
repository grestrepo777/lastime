## Overview

Built a hands-on EDR lab environment leveraging Microsoft Defender for Endpoint on both VM and host machines. The lab simulated malware-like behaviors using an EICAR file, which was captured and analyzed in the MDE portal. This environment allowed for testing alerting, investigation, and incident response workflows in a safe, controlled setting.  

## Key Features

- **Onboard Devices**: Successfully onboarded Windows Server 2022 VM and host Windows 11 machine to MDE.
- **Telemetry Generation**: Generated process, file, and alert events using EICAR test files. 
- **Alert Monitoring**: Verified that telemetry events appeared in the portal and could be queried.  
- **SOC Workflow Simulation**: Practiced alert investigation and process analysis. 

## Technologies Used

- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)**: Endpoint detection, telemetry, and alert management. 
- **PowerShell**: Onboarding scripts, process simulation, and telemetry generation.
- **Windows Server 2022/Windows 11**: Lab environment and endpoint testing. 

## Challenges and Learnings

A key challenge was correctly onboarding the Windows Server 2022 VM. Originally I had tried to onboard a regular Windows 10 VM and after a while of unsuccessful attempts I found out that I could not onboard Windows Home devices. Eventually, I found out that I could onboard a Windows Server 2022 VM I already had for a different project. Another challenge was figuring out how to test the alerts on the MDE portal but I found out I could use an EICAR file. 

## Outcome

The EDR lab successfully demonstrated the end-to-end flow of threat detection and investigation in MDE. Telemetry from simulated test events could be visualized, queried, and analyzed, providing hands-on experience in SOC operations.
