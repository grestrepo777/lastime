## Overview

These scripting projects were built in Python to sharpen skills in network security and log analysis. The focus was on creating lightweight tools that automate common security tasks, such as scanning ports to assess system exposure and parsing logs to identify suspicious activity. Together, these projects demonstrate the ability to apply scripting knowledge to solve real-world security problems efficiently.
## Key Features

### ðŸ”¹ TCP Port Scanner
- **Flexible Scanning**: Allowed scanning of a IP address entered. 
- **Connection Handling**: Used Python's 'socket' library to attempt TCP connections and identify open ports. 
- **Error Handling**: Managed invalid inputs, unreachable hosts, or closed ports

### ðŸ”¹ Log Parser
- **Regex-Based Parsing**: Implemented Python's 're' module to extract IPs, timestemps, and error codes.
- **Custom Filters**: Supported filtering logs by severity level or specific keywords. 
- **Data Insights**: Counted recurring issues (e.g., failed logins, frequent errors) for security monitoring.


## Technologies / Libraries Used

- **Python**: Core langauges for scripting. 
- **Socket Library**: For network connections and port scanning. 
- **Regex (re module)**: For pattern matching and parsing log files. 


## Challenges and Learnings
A key challenge was designing scripts that are both **flexible and user-friendly**, since real-world logs and network configurations can vary widely. 
- For the **Port Scanner**, the challenge was balancing speed and reliability - handling timesouts and connection errors required exception handling. 
- For the **Log Parser**, learning how to build regex patterns without missing edge cases was a big challenge and an import lesson. 

## Outcome
These tools provided practical, hands-on experience in: 
- **Network Enumeration** with custom-built port scanning. 
- **Log Analysis** for detecting potential security incidents. 

While lightweight, these projects demonstrate a foundation in security automation - skills directly applicable in roles such as SOC analyst, Security Engineer, or Penetration Tester.
