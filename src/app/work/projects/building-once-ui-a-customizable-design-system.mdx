## Overview

Currently working on a neural network project that focuses on learning and predicting binary representation of numerical and textual data. The goal is to demonstrate the neural network's ability to generalize patterns in binary inputs. 

## Key Features

- **Binary Encoding**: Preprocessing data into binary format to train the neural network effectively. 
- **Custom Neural Network Architecture**: Designing layers and activation functions suitable for pattern recognition in binary data. 
- **Training & Evaluation**: Implementing training pipelines with appropriate loss functions and metrics to assess model performance. 

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For building and testing the neural network. 
- **PyTorch**: For constructing and training the neural network model. 
- **NumPy & Pandas**: For data preprocessing and manipulation

## Challenges and Learnings

TBA

## Outcome

The project aims to provide a neural network capable of accurately predicting binary representations and serving as a foundation for further experiments with bianry data processing and representation learning.
